**A very simple personal ticketing system (task management / todo-list system).**

Some functionalities are not yet implemented. I made this in a hurry because I needed something for myself urgently while coping with unprecedented workload during the final months of a PhD ðŸ˜…

If you want to use this, just clone this repo and open `output/index.html` in your browser. That's it, no further installation necessary, this runs 100% in your browser and all data is managed by [Window.localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).

## Manage ticket using console (provisional/interim solution)

Rename the current ticket:

```js
DataHelper.globalCurrentSelectedItem.title = 'New title goes here please';
```

To make changes persistent, save changes to LocalStorage:

```js
DataHelper.saveItemsToLocalStorage();
```
